Literally just Information-Gathering

Welcome to the Information-Gathering wiki!

http://www.powershellempire.com/ ----- Powershell Empire "Empire is a pure PowerShell post-exploitation agent built on cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework."

https://github.com/bloodhoundad/bloodhound ----- BloodHound "BloodHound is a single page Javascript web application, built on top of Linkurious, compiled with Electron, with a Neo4j database fed by a PowerShell ingestor. BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment."

https://github.com/nullarray/autosploit ----- Autosploit "As the name might suggest AutoSploit attempts to automate the exploitation of remote hosts. Targets can be collected automatically through Shodan, Censys or Zoomeye. But options to add your custom targets and host lists have been included as well. The available Metasploit modules have been selected to facilitate Remote Code Execution and to attempt to gain Reverse TCP Shells and/or Meterpreter sessions. Workspace, local host and local port for MSF facilitated back connections are configured by filling out the dialog that comes up before the exploit component is started"

https://github.com/mazenelzanaty/twlocation ----- TwLocation "Python script that gets Twwitter users' tweets location"

https://github.com/aboul3la/sublist3r ----- Sublist3r "Sublist3r is a python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT. It helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains for the domain they are targeting. Sublist3r enumerates subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, and Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates subdomains using Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster, and ReverseDNS.

subbrute was integrated with Sublist3r to increase the possibility of finding more subdomains using bruteforce with an improved wordlist. The credit goes to TheRook who is the author of subbrute."

https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute ----- SubBrute "SubBrute is a community driven project with the goal of creating the fastest, and most accurate subdomain enumeration tool. Some of the magic behind SubBrute is that it uses open resolvers as a kind of proxy to circumvent DNS rate-limiting (https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A). This design also provides a layer of anonymity, as SubBrute does not send traffic directly to the target's name servers."

https://github.com/nextronsystems/aptsimulator ----- APTSimulator "APT Simulator is a Windows Batch script that uses a set of tools and output files to make a system look as if it was compromised. In contrast to other adversary simulation tools, APT Simulator is deisgned to make the application as simple as possible. You don't need to run a web server, database or any agents on set of virtual machines. Just download the prepared archive, extract and run the contained Batch file as Administrator. Running APT Simulator takes less than a minute of your time."

https://github.com/1N3/intruderpayloads ------ IntruderPayloads "A collection of Burpsuite Intruder payloads and fuzz lists and pentesting methodology. To pull down all 3rd party repos, run install.sh in the same directory of the IntruderPayloads folder."

https://github.com/sans-dfir/sift-cli ----- SIFT "The SIFT Workstation is a group of free open-source incident response and forensic tools designed to perform detailed digital forensic examinations in a variety of settings. It can match any current incident response and forensic tool suite. SIFT demonstrates that advanced incident response capabilities and deep dive digital forensic techniques to intrusions can be accomplished using cutting-edge open-source tools that are freely available and frequently updated."

https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial ----- YSoSerial? "A proof-of-concept tool for generating payloads that exploit unsafe Java object deserialization."

https://github.com/pwntester/ysoserial.net ----- YSoSerial.net "A proof-of-concept tool for generating payloads that exploit unsafe .NET object deserialization."
