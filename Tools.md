http://www.powershellempire.com/ ----- Powershell Empire "Empire is a pure PowerShell post-exploitation agent built on cryptologically-secure communications and a flexible architecture. Empire implements the ability to run PowerShell agents without needing powershell.exe, rapidly deployable post-exploitation modules ranging from key loggers to Mimikatz, and adaptable communications to evade network detection, all wrapped up in a usability-focused framework."

https://github.com/bloodhoundad/bloodhound ----- BloodHound "BloodHound is a single page Javascript web application, built on top of Linkurious, compiled with Electron, with a Neo4j database fed by a PowerShell ingestor. BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory environment. Attackers can use BloodHound to easily identify highly complex attack paths that would otherwise be impossible to quickly identify. Defenders can use BloodHound to identify and eliminate those same attack paths. Both blue and red teams can use BloodHound to easily gain a deeper understanding of privilege relationships in an Active Directory environment."

https://github.com/nullarray/autosploit ----- Autosploit "As the name might suggest AutoSploit attempts to automate the exploitation of remote hosts. Targets can be collected automatically through Shodan, Censys or Zoomeye. But options to add your custom targets and host lists have been included as well. The available Metasploit modules have been selected to facilitate Remote Code Execution and to attempt to gain Reverse TCP Shells and/or Meterpreter sessions. Workspace, local host and local port for MSF facilitated back connections are configured by filling out the dialog that comes up before the exploit component is started"

https://github.com/aboul3la/sublist3r ----- Sublist3r "Sublist3r is a python tool designed to enumerate subdomains of websites using OSINT. It helps penetration testers and bug hunters collect and gather subdomains for the domain they are targeting. Sublist3r enumerates subdomains using many search engines such as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Baidu, and Ask. Sublist3r also enumerates subdomains using Netcraft, Virustotal, ThreatCrowd, DNSdumpster, and ReverseDNS.

subbrute was integrated with Sublist3r to increase the possibility of finding more subdomains using bruteforce with an improved wordlist. The credit goes to TheRook who is the author of subbrute."

https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute ----- SubBrute "SubBrute is a community driven project with the goal of creating the fastest, and most accurate subdomain enumeration tool. Some of the magic behind SubBrute is that it uses open resolvers as a kind of proxy to circumvent DNS rate-limiting (https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/TA13-088A). This design also provides a layer of anonymity, as SubBrute does not send traffic directly to the target's name servers."

https://github.com/nextronsystems/aptsimulator ----- APTSimulator "APT Simulator is a Windows Batch script that uses a set of tools and output files to make a system look as if it was compromised. In contrast to other adversary simulation tools, APT Simulator is deisgned to make the application as simple as possible. You don't need to run a web server, database or any agents on set of virtual machines. Just download the prepared archive, extract and run the contained Batch file as Administrator. Running APT Simulator takes less than a minute of your time."

https://github.com/1N3/intruderpayloads ------ IntruderPayloads "A collection of Burpsuite Intruder payloads and fuzz lists and pentesting methodology. To pull down all 3rd party repos, run install.sh in the same directory of the IntruderPayloads folder."

https://github.com/sans-dfir/sift-cli ----- SIFT "The SIFT Workstation is a group of free open-source incident response and forensic tools designed to perform detailed digital forensic examinations in a variety of settings. It can match any current incident response and forensic tool suite. SIFT demonstrates that advanced incident response capabilities and deep dive digital forensic techniques to intrusions can be accomplished using cutting-edge open-source tools that are freely available and frequently updated."

https://github.com/dchrastil/scrapedin ----- 
ScrapedIntool to scrape LinkedIn
this tool assists in performing reconnaissance using the LinkedIn.com website/API. Provide a search string just as you would on the original website and let ScrapedIn do all the dirty work. Output is stored as an XLSX file, however it is intended to be used with Google Spreadsheets. After importing the XLSX into Google Spreadsheets there will be a "dataset" worksheet and a "report" worksheet.

https://github.com/thec00n/smart-contract-honeypots ----- This repo contains a collection of smart contract honeypots.

https://github.com/mirsamantajbakhsh/onionharvester ----- A  small TOR Onion Address harvester for checking if the address is available or not. The program uses the TOR local socks5 proxy for finding all the Onion Addresses which are alive and ports 80 and 443 are available. Details about the project and TOR onion harvesting is published in my personal blog at: Onion Harvester

https://github.com/clong/detectionlab ----- This lab has been designed with defenders in mind. Its primary purpose is to allow the user to quickly build a Windows domain that comes pre-loaded with security tooling and some best practices when it comes to system logging configurations. It can easily be modified to fit most needs or expanded to include additional hosts.
Read more about Detection Lab on Medium here: https://medium.com/@clong/introducing-detection-lab-61db34bed6ae
NOTE: This lab has not been hardened in any way and runs with default vagrant credentials. Please do not connect or bridge it to any networks you care about. This lab is deliberately designed to be insecure; the primary purpose of it is to provide visibility and introspection into each host.

https://github.com/paralax/awesome-honeypots ----- A curated list of awesome honeypots, tools, components and much more. The list is divided into categories such as web, services, and others, focusing on open source projects.

Identify common parameters vulnerable to certain vulnerability classes (HUNT Scanner, availible for Burp Suite PRO and ZAProxy).Organize testing methodologies (currently avalible only inside of Burp Suite). 

https://github.com/silascutler/malpipe ----- MalPipe is a modular malware (and indicator) collection and processing framework. It is designed to pull malware, domains, URLs and IP addresses from multiple feeds, enrich the collected data and export the results.

https://github.com/UltimateHackers/XSStrike ----- XSStrike is an advanced XSS detection suite. It has a powerful fuzzing engine and provides zero false positive result using fuzzy matching. XSStrike is the first XSS scanner to generate its own payloads. It is intelligent enough to detect and break out of various contexts.

https://github.com/1N3/BlackWidow ----- BlackWidow is a python based web application spider to gather subdomains, URL's, dynamic parameters, email addresses and phone numbers from a target website. This project also includes Inject-X fuzzer to scan dynamic URL's for common OWASP vulnerabilities.

https://github.com/UnaPibaGeek/ctfr ----- CTFR
Do you miss AXFR technique? This tool allows to get the subdomains from a HTTPS website in a few seconds.
How it works? CTFR does not use neither dictionary attack nor brute-force, it just abuses of Certificate Transparency logs.
For more information about CT logs, check www.certificate-transparency.org and crt.sh 

https://github.com/jivoi/openssh-backdoor-kit ----- OpenSSH Backdoor kit
magic password to get shell with any user (encrypted or no)

you can chose directory of log decryptor and directory of sniff-logs.
all connections accepted by backdoor wont logged by lastlog/wtmp/udp.
simple setup, just setup.sh!
fake banner and fake version, if admin do ssh -v or sshd -v banner will be faked! :~
