# Information-Gathering

Resources that are freely available for use by anyone to help dive into InfoSec.  Give credit where credit is due.

Remember to stay up to date on the latest news setup accounts for RSS feeds, Twitter account dedicated to Infosec people and Reddit dedicated to following technical subreddits and sometimes just kick back and listen to a podcast.

My Setup on keeping up to date

I like having this on one dedicated monitor.
https://radar.securitywizardry.com/ ----- Up to Date Cyber Threat Intelligence page refreshes every 5 minutes

Feedly RSS Feed
https://feedly.com/ ----- I created a dedicated Infosec feed currently following [BleepingComputer][CISA Alerts][Daniel Miessler][Dark Reading][Darknet][Fire Eye Threat Research][Information Security Buzz][Krebs on Security][Naked Security][SANS Internet Storm][Schneier on Security][SecurityWeek][The Hacker News][The Register - Security][ZDNet | security RSS]

Reddit both a learning and news platform (When following the correct subreddits).  You can sometimes spot things being released here before everywhere else has a chance to build an article.  At one point I had just about no clue what they were talking about in some of these subreddits but it also gave me the opportunity to dig into them and see how it may be related to a system I am working with.  Remember to check out their pinned posts they usually have really good information.
https://reddit.com ----- What I like to follow [r/sysadmin][r/AskNetsec][r/bugbounty][r/cybersecurity][r/hacking][r/hackthebox][r/homelab][r/HowToHack][r/netsec][r/OSINT][r/securityCTF]

https://twitter.com ----- At first I was hesitant then realized that their can be some really good information coming directly from InfoSec people all around the world.  It's great you can get information directly from the source.  I kept following InfoSec people and clicking follow on the suggested box and then I started unfollowing or muting those I felt were spending more time on shitposting.  I'll only list a couple here you can either go to my Twitter and check out who I currenlty follow or just start randomly following how I explained earlier.

Choose your podcast app of choice.
https://securityweekly.com/
Paul's Security Weekly has a range of episodes to choose between the week also have some technical segments with their guests.  You can also catch those technical segments on YouTube.
SANS Internet Storm Center Daily. Monday-Friday it get's updated, if your in a rush this can be a good catch up on what's happening in InfoSec.
https://darknetdiaries.com/
Darknet Diaries.  Investigated and told by Jack Rhysider I highly recommend this podcast.  Hearing the stories of the past will help give you an idea of what and how to defend or attack against infrastructure.

Emails & websites.  You should probably create a emails rule to avoid getting bombarded.

If the organization you work with is mainly Microsoft I recommend subscribing to Randy Smith's Windows Newsletter.  The day of or after 
Patch Tuesday he sends out a email summarizing the patches and what is also being exploited or disclosed.

SANS Internet Storm also releases a patch summary that highlights whether it is exploited or disclosed.
I usually Google it a couple days after patch tuesday. Example (sans internet storm microsoft (month year) patch tuesday
